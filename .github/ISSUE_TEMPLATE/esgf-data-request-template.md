**Describe the data you want**

Be specific about ESGF facets, a missing facet means you are interested in all values of that facet:

- CMIP6 - project, activity_id, institution_id, source_id, experiment_id, member_id, table_id, variable_id, grid_label, frequency
- CMIP5 - project, product, institute, model, experiment, time_frequency, realm, cmor_table, ensemble, time_frequency
- CORDEX - project, product, domain, institute, driving_model, experiment, ensemble, rcm_name, rcm_version, time_frequency, variable
- Generic facets
  - latest - All ESGF versions of the dataset or only the most recent one (`true`/`false`)

For example, the following requests all members for model ACCESS-CM2 at daily resolution for two future scenarios:

```
project=CMIP6
activity_id=ScenarioMIP experiment_id=ssp370,ssp585
source_id=ACCESS-CM2
table_id=day
variable_id=tas
grid_label=fr
latest=true
```
